# dataloader
(under construction)

A java version of the dataloader pattern
This is my take of the facebook dataloader pattern.

Similar to the [java-dataloader](https://github.com/graphql-java/java-dataloader) but it is not graphql related.

wrapp a batch api, and allow multiple requests to be batched under the hood. This is a [reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) based dataloader
