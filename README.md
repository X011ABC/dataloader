# dataloader
A java version of the dataloader pattern
This is my take of the facebook dataloader pattern.

Similar to the (java-dataloader)[https://github.com/graphql-java/java-dataloader] but it is not graphql related.

wrapp a batch api, and allow multiple requests to be batched nuder the hood. This is a reqctor based dataloader
